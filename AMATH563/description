AMATH 563
Inferring Structure of Complex Systems
Spring 2019
Taught by Dr. J. Nathan Kutz
University of Washington

"Introduces fundamental concepts of network science and graph theory 
for complex dynamical systems. Merges concepts from model selection, 
information theory, statistical inference, neural networks, deep learning, 
and machine learning for building reduced order models of dynamical systems 
using sparse sampling of high-dimensional data."
This course completes a sequence of three core courses for an applied math PhD.
